What Is A Youth

By Eugene Walter

What is a youth? Impetuous fire

����Ϊ�Σ����ܵĻ��棬

What is a maid? Ice and desire

��ŮΪ�Σ���ѩ��������

The world wags on

������������

A rose will bloom, it then will fade

Ǿޱ�����ţ��漴�ֵ��㣬

So does a youth, so does the fairest maid

������ˣ���������Ů����ˡ�

Comes a time when one's sweet smile

��ʱЦ�����ۣ�

Has its season for a while

���ǰ��ļ���

Then love's in love with me

���������ļ䵴��

Some may think only to marry

�������ͷ����

Others will tease and tarry

���˷곡��Ϸ�����鲻��

Mine is the very best parry��

�ҵĽ�����Ǹ߳���

Cupid he rules us all

����֧��������

Caper the caper, sing me the song

ȸԾ�ɣ���Ϸ�ɣ�Ϊ�Ҹ߳�һ��

Death will come soon to hush us along

���񽫺ܿ쵽�������������Ĭ��

Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall

��ȷ����絨�࣬

Love is a past time and never will pall

�����������ţ�ȴ��ζ���

Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall

��ȷ����絨�࣬

Cupid he rules us all

����֧��������

A rose will bloom, it then will fade

õ���ʢ�����漴�ֵ��㣬

So does a youth, so does the fairest maid

������ˣ���������Ů����ˡ�
