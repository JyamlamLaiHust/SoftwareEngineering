My mom was driving me back from practice. We were talking. All was well. The conversation slowly tones down. And she says smiling, "By the way, today's my birthday. No one reminded me so I thought I should just say so."

She laughed. A laugh so painful I wanted to cry. She hasn't had a proper birthday celebration in two decades.

The hardest truth, you ask? Love is one sided, most of the time.

������п����ʵ��ʲô�����ǵ���ģ������ʱ������ˡ�

That's because most people want love but not the responsibility it comes with. A parent takes all that responsibility. They take it all. I promise you. They'll take it to their grave. Even if they never get it back.

8) There's a reason older people keep cats and dogs as pets. These animals really are the best company in the world.

10) Lying, gossiping, cheating, and stealing happen all the time in the world of work. People will spread lies about you, even though you've done nothing wrong.
