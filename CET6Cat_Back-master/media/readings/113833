Remember young days in the past.

People were sincere and honest.

They honored what they said.

Early morning in the railway station.

Long, dark and empty was the street.

The soybean milk diner was steaming with heat.

Days were slower in the past.

Carriage, horse, and mail did not reach fast.

You need your lifetime to just love the person who is right.

The lock was fine in the past.

The key was exquisite and fit.

You lock and he will get it.
