I have a neighbor. He shouts at his kids a lot. He has a close friend with a little girl, Mindy. Does this guy also shout at his kids a lot? I don't know...

The other day, my neighbor's son Marco, 6, and Mindy, also 6, rang my door bell. "Marco threw his monster ball on your balcony. We want to get it - if you won't be angry?"

Me: Of course I won't be angry. Come in.

Mindy: Are you really not angry?

���ϣ������û��������

Me: No.

Mindy: When are you angry?

���ϣ�����ʲôʱ������ѽ��

Me: I'm never angry with kids.

�ң��ҴӲ�������������

Mindy: Really?

���ϣ������

Me: Yes.

�ң���ġ�

Mindy: Never?

���ϣ�����û�У�

Me: Never.

�ң�����û�С�

Mindy: Not even if we do something wrong?

���ϣ���ʹ����������Ҳ��������

Me: No. I'd probably tell you it was wrong, but I wouldn't be angry.

Mindy looked at me, then repeated: "You won't be angry with me?"

Me: I will never be angry with you.

She looked at me again, for a few seconds, then flung herself into my arms.

I didn't even know her, before this. There's no saying exactly what the background is, but I found it sad.
