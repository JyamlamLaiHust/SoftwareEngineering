If you were coming in the fall

If you were coming in the fall,

����������＾������

I'd brush the summer by

�һ��õ��Ӱ��＾������

With half a smile and half a spurn,

һ�����һ�뺬Ц��

As housewives do a fly.

��ܼҸ��Ѳ�Ӭ���ܡ�

If I could see you in a year,

���һ����ܹ����㣬

I'd wind the months in balls,

�ҽ������²��Ƴ��� —

And put them each in separate drawers,

�ֱ����ڲ�ͬ�ĳ��룬

Until their time befalls.

��ã����������� —

If only centuries delayed,

���ֻ���鼸�����ͣ�

I'd count them on my hand,

�һ����ҵ������ —

Subtracting till my fingers dropped

����ָ��һ����ֱ��

Into Van Diemen’s land.

ȫ�����������˹��

If certain, when this life was out,

���ȷ֪���ۻ������� —

That yours and mine should be,

��ĺ��ҵ�����������ʱ —

I'd toss it yonder like a rind,

��Ը����������� —

And taste eternity.

��ͬ����һƬ��Ƥ —

But now, all ignorant of the length

������������ȷ֪

Of time's uncertain wing,

������ж೤ʱ�� —

It goads me, like the goblin bee,

��״����ʹ���������� —

That will not state its sting.
