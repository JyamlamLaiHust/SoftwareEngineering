Hope Betrayed

���ߣ���ѩ�ۣ����ߣ�David Hawkes

һ������Է���⣬

One was a flower from paradise,

һ����������覣�

One a pure jade without spot or stain.

��˵û��Ե��

If each of the other one was not intended,

����ƫ����������

Then why in this life did they meet again?

��˵����Ե��

And yet if fate had meant them for each other,

����������黯?

why was their earthly meeting all in vain?

һ�������ѽ��

In vain were all his anxious fears

һ������ǣ�ҡ�

All, insubstantial, doomed to pass

һ����ˮ���£�

As moonlight mirrored in the water

һ���Ǿ��л���

Or flowers reflected in a glass.

���������ж����������

How many tears from those poor eyes could flow,

�������������������������ģ�

Which every season rained upon her woe?
